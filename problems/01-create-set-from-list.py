# Given a list of items, create a set from the list. Note the differences with
# performing the same action in JavaScript.

# Write your code here.
items = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]
new_set = set(items)

print(new_set)


# const items = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]

# const newSet
# (Hint: Does declaring a new set require any keywords like `new`?)
